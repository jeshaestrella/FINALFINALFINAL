LIFE is beautiful but not always easy, it has problems, too, and the challenge<br/> lies in facing them with courage, letting the beauty of life act like a balm,<br/> which makes the pain bearable, during trying times, by providing hope<br/>
Happiness, sorrow, victory, defeat, day-night are the two sides of the coin.<br/>Similarly life is full of moments of joy, pleasure, success and comfort <br/>punctuated by misery, defeat, failures and problems.<br/> There is no human being on Earth, strong, powerful, wise <br/>or rich, who has not experienced, struggle, suffering or failure.<br/>
<br/> A person who has not encountered difficulties in life can never achieve <br/>success.Difficulties test the courage, patience, perseverance and true character <br/>of a human being. Adversity and hardships make a person <br/>strong and ready to face the challenges of life with equanimity.<br/> There is no doubt that there can be no gain without pain.<br/> It is only when one toils and sweats it out <br/>that success is nourished and sustained.</br>
LIFE is beautiful just as roses but it has challenges which are like thorns and <br/>have to be faced and overcome by all. Those, who accept these, <br/>challenges and succeed, are the ones, who know how to live life in its <br/>true sense. Thus, enjoy life but also be prepared to bear the pricks of pain.</br>
