<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BONJOUR!
I'm Jesha Nicole T. Estrella , 19 years old and the eldest daughter of Sharon Estrella and Jigger Estrella. 
I can simply say that I am a joyful kind of a person, also I am a good student leader which leads me to more opportunities
and challenges related in my course. I am currently taking BS-Psychology at De La Salle University Dasmarinas.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PSYCHOLOGY MAJOR
Some of my relatives thought that I will not be able to stick in this course. why? because this course is not my first choice
but, later i realized that this helps me to be more confident as a person and be able to understand myself more and the
others.

<p>Movies are important because there are lessons that can be learned through the relatedness of the movie and the individual watching a movie. 
I love to watch Horror, Romance and Comedy.</p>
<br/>
<p>EAT! well, my stress reliever! whenever I am stressed out of something I always find a way to make myself comfortable and be able to lift myself up.</p>
</br>
<p>VOLLEYBALL! is my favorite sport and I want to excel in this field of sport because it boosts my inner self; the competitiveness in me within others.</p>
